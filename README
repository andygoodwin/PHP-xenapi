---------------
PHP XenAPI v1.0
---------------

Copyright (C) 2010 Andy Goodwin <andyg@unf.net>

This class requires PHP5, xmlrpc and curl.

The class provides convienence to the Citrix XenServer API (via xmlrpc).  It wraps
the xmlrpc + curl + session handling with the api.

------
Usage:
------

include('xenapi.php');

$url = "https://10.0.0.1"; /* URL of the Citrix XenSerer */
$login = "root"; /* login/user for the citrix box */
$password = "password"; /* password for the user */

/* Establish session with Xenserver */
$xenserver = new XenApi($url, $login, $password);

/* Once sucessfully logged in - any method (valid or not) is passed to the XenServer.

Replace the first period (.) of the method with a underscore (_) - because PHP doesnt like 
periods in the function names.

All the methods (other then logging in) require passing the session_id as the first parameter,
however this is done automatically - so you do not need to pass it.

For example, to do VM.get_all(session_id) and get all the vms as an array, then get/print the details of each
using VM.get_record(session_id, self) (self = VM object):
 */

$vms_array = $xenserver->VM_get_all();

foreach ($vms_array as $vm) {
    $record = $xenserver->VM_get_record($vm);
    print_r($record);
}

/*

For parameters/usage, check out:

    http://docs.vmd.citrix.com/XenServer/5.5.0/1.0/en_gb/api/docs/html/browser.html

To see how parametes are returned, print_r() is your friend :)
